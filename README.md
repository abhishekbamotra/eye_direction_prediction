# Eye Direction Classification

Currently working on eye direction classification. We have four classes in our data: left, right, forward and close. This can be used to help people with paralysis or related diseases which can stop them from doing even small movements.

Let's hope the results are good and we are able to deploy the results in real life and bring a change.
